Day 15 – SQL CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

On Day 15, I focused on understanding and using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
to write cleaner, more readable, and maintainable SQL queries.

Instead of relying on deeply nested subqueries, I learned how to
break complex logic into clear, named steps using CTEs.

Key concepts practiced:
- What a CTE is and how it works
- Writing single and multiple CTEs using WITH
- Replacing nested subqueries with readable CTE-based logic
- Reusing intermediate query results
- Combining CTEs with JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING
- Improving query readability for analytical use cases

Problems solved:
- Calculating total spending per student using a CTE
- Identifying high-value students by comparing against average spending
- Course-wise enrollment counts using CTEs
- Finding popular courses using CTE-based aggregation
- Rewriting complex subqueries from earlier days using CTEs

What I learned:
- CTEs act like temporary, named result sets within a query
- Complex queries become easier to debug when broken into steps
- CTEs improve both readability and maintainability of SQL
- CTE-based queries are preferred in real-world analytics work

This day helped me write more professional SQL
and strengthened my ability to explain query logic clearly in interviews.
