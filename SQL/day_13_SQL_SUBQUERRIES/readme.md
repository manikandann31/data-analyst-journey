Day 13 – Advanced SQL (Subqueries & Analytical Queries)

On Day 13, I focused on advanced SQL problem-solving using
subqueries combined with JOINs to answer comparison-based
and analytical business questions.

Tables used:
- students
- courses
- enrollments

Key concepts practiced:
- Single-row subqueries (above average comparisons)
- Nested subqueries with aggregation
- JOIN + GROUP BY + HAVING combinations
- Identifying missing data using LEFT JOIN and NULL handling
- Comparing grouped results against overall metrics
- Understanding logical execution order of SQL queries

Problems solved:
- Courses priced above the average course price
- Students enrolled in high-cost courses
- Courses with enrollments above average enrollment count
- Students with no enrollments
- Students whose total spending exceeds the average spending per student

Challenges faced:
- Initially confused “top results” with “above average” logic
- Learned that ORDER BY + LIMIT is not suitable for comparative analysis
- Understood when subqueries are required instead of simple aggregations

This day significantly improved my analytical thinking
and helped me write interview-ready SQL queries
that answer real-world business questions.
