Day 12 – SQL JOINs (Multi-table Analysis)

On Day 12, I worked on understanding and implementing SQL JOINs
using a real-world styled dataset from an online course platform.

Tables used:
- courses
- students
- g total revenue generated by each course
- Identifying courses with no enrollments
- Finding students enrolled in more than one course
- Analyzing popular course categories based on enrollments

What I learned:
- INNER JOIN returns only matching records across tables
- LEFT JOIN is essential for identifying missing or unmatched data
- JOINs are the backbone of real-world SQL analytics
- Business questions often require combining data from multiple tables

This day helped me understand how normalized databases are queried
in real applications and improved my confidence in writing
interview-ready SQL JOIN queries with execution.
enrollments

Key concepts practiced:
- INNER JOIN to combine related records across tables
- LEFT JOIN to identify missing relationships (e.g., courses with no enrollments)
- JOIN with GROUP BY for aggregation
- JOIN with HAVING for conditional group filtering
- Revenue calculation using JOIN + aggregation

Problems solved:
- Displaying course names with enrolled student names
- Counting students enrolled per course
- Calculatin
