Day 11 – Advanced SQL Aggregation & HAVING

On Day 11, I focused on solving advanced SQL problems using
GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, and conditional aggregation.

Key concepts practiced:
- Difference between WHERE and HAVING
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG)
- Filtering grouped data using HAVING
- Using subqueries to compare with overall averages
- Multi-condition HAVING clauses
- Conditional aggregation using CASE
- Department-wise, semester-wise, and gender-based analysis

What I learned:
- WHERE filters rows before grouping, HAVING filters groups after aggregation
- ORDER BY with LIMIT gives top results, not comparative results
- Subqueries are essential for “above overall average” type problems
- CASE inside aggregation helps compare categories like gender

Challenges faced:
- Initially confused top results with above-average conditions
- Learned to translate business questions into correct SQL logic
- Improved understanding of how databases process grouped data

This day significantly improved my analytical thinking
and helped me write interview-ready SQL queries with real execution.
